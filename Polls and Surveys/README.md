<strong>Polls and Surveys</strong>

CandidatePoll1

This is a simple, three-question poll about voters' intentions in the upcoming election. The answers to all three questions are stashed so that they can be exported and analyzed.

CandidatePoll2

This poll asks recipients to choose between a selection of several candidates. If the preferred candidate is selected, the poll ends. If any other candidate is selected, the system asks a follow-up question in order to promote the candidacy of the preferred choice. As you can imagine, this is a partisan dream.

CustomerSatisfaction

This survey captures responses in two different ways. There are questions that ask the recipient to rate the company and its services on a sliding scale from one to nine; all responses are recorded. There is also a question that asks for the reason that the customer contacted the company in the first place. As we cannot capture that answer with a simple keypress, we need to use a record tag to allow the recipient to leave a message. 

JobInterviewSurvey

This IVR was created for a customer who wanted to collect follow-up data from interviewees. It asks questions, and uses record tags to record the responses. The only drawback is that it requires you to download and listen to each response in order to extract any useful data.

MarketingSurvey

This IVR queries a recipient's preferences in regards to an upcoming marketing campaign. It asks them to indicate their preferences through keypresses, and records their responses.

PoliticalSurvey

This survey was used to ask if voters would be voting for a new mayoral candidate, and if they supported the outgoing administration. The final question asks if the recipient will canvass for the candidate, and includes the option to transfer the call to the field office.

Two-AnswerQuestion

This simple poll records a yes/no response.
