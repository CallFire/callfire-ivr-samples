====================

This page is a repository of CallFire XML samples that can be used to create inbound or outbound IVRs.

The IVR examples presented here assume that the user has a basic understanding of the XML mark-up language, a basic outline of which is available on the <a href="https://www.callfire.com/help/docs/callfire-xml">CallFire XML Help Page.</a>

In each of the folders above, you will find sample IVRs written in CallFire XML, along with a description of what each IVR is designed to do, as well as some real-world usage scenarios.

A list of system variables, including how times and dates are expressed in CallFire XML, can be found <a href="https://www.callfire.com/help/docs/callfire-xml/system-variables">here.</a>
